# chi-covid19-narrative
This project uses the Chart.js library to visualize data available through Chicago Data Portal's APIs about the City's response to COVID-19. You can view the GitHub Pages website for this repo at [crunes.github.io/chi-covid19-narrative](https://crunes.github.io/chi-covid19-narrative/).

## Installation
The first step is to install the Chart.js library. You can install Chart.js in a couple of ways.

1. Use a CDN
This is how I included Chart.js because it is easy and fast. You can grab the latest CDN link from [https://cdnjs.com/libraries/Chart.js](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/Chart.js). Copy the URL that has Chart.min.js at the end.

At the time of this writing, the latest version is 2.9.3, so I used the following link:

`https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/Chart.js/2.9.3/Chart.min.js`

2. Use npm
Copy and paste the command below to download it in your project: 

`npm install chart.js --save`
